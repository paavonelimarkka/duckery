# duckery
Duckery is a funny game

## Workflow

- Use the sandbox scene for random development, it is ignored for git
- Import ThirdPersonController yourself
- Media folder is ignored, lets use dropbox or something for media files

## Initial plan (MVP)

- You play a mommy duck
- Your baby ducklings are doing stupid duckery and you must save as much as you can
- You can save them by going near and getting them to follow you
- When theres no ducklings left without mommy game ends
- How many ducklings did you save?

### Possible dangers

- Well
- Dog
- Human
- Car
- Lawa
